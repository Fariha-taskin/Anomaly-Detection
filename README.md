What do we mean by Anomaly? Something that is not usual. Here we used some custom function to detect anomaly using Time Series forecasting methods. 
Note that these functions only works for additive series only. If you have a multiplicative series, add a log transformation. If $Y_t$ is the original series, then transform using

$$L_t=\log(Y_t)$$
